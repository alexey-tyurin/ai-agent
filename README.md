# AI Research Paper Search Agent

An intelligent agent that searches, analyzes, and ranks arXiv research papers using LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, and DuckDuckGo. 

The AI agent helps researchers find relevant papers by understanding search intent and providing iterative refinement of search results.

## The Story Behind the Project

### The Problem

As AI researcher and developer, I frequently found myself drowning in a sea of academic papers. The traditional process was time-consuming and frustrating:
- Spending hours scanning through papers to find relevant research
- Reading lengthy abstracts that might not align with my needs
- Manually tracking and organizing papers across different topics
- Missing important papers due to poor keyword matches
- Getting stuck in research rabbit holes that led nowhere

### The Solution

This frustration led to the development of the AI Research Paper Search Agent that can work as AI Research Assistant. 

The goal was simple: create a tool that thinks like a researcher but works at the speed of a computer. 

The AI agent doesn't just find papers â€“ it understands them, explains their relevance, and helps refine the search based on what you actually need.

Key innovations:
- **Intent Understanding**: Unlike traditional keyword searches, the AI agent understands research goals and matches papers based on actual relevance
- **Intelligent Refinement**: The system learns from your feedback and refines searches iteratively
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Each paper is automatically summarized and evaluated for relevance to your specific research goals
- **Time Efficiency**: What used to take days can now be accomplished in minutes

### Development Journey

The project evolved through several stages:

1. **Initial Prototype**: Started with a simple script using OpenAI's API to summarize papers
2. **Architecture Evolution**:
   - Added DuckDuckGo integration for broader paper discovery
   - Used LangGraph to implement structured AI workflows
   - Developed a ranking system based on relevance scoring
3. **User Experience**:
   - Created an intuitive web interface with Gradio
   - Added interactive refinement capabilities
   - Implemented session management for iterative searches
4. **Optimization**:
   - Improved rate limiting and error handling
   - Added asynchronous processing for better performance
   - Enhanced abstract extraction reliability

## Use Cases

The AI agent can be used for:
- **Academic Research**: PhD students using it to conduct comprehensive literature reviews
- **Industry R&D**: Companies tracking technological developments in their field
- **Cross-Domain Research**: Researchers exploring intersections between different fields
- **Education**: Students getting quick overviews of complex research areas

## Features

- **Intelligent Paper Search**: Searches arXiv papers using DuckDuckGo with date range filtering
- **Automated Analysis**: Generates paper summaries and explains relevance to search intent
- **Smart Ranking**: Ranks papers based on relevance to research goals using LLM
- **Interactive Refinement**: Allows users to refine search intent based on initial results
- **Web Interface**: Clean Gradio interface for easy interaction
- **Iterative Search**: Supports up to 3 iterations of intent refinement per search session

## Technical Stack

- **LangGraph**: For building the AI agent workflow
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For paper analysis and ranking
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: For paper discovery
- **Gradio**: For web interface
- **Beautiful Soup**: For paper abstract extraction
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and modeling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexey-tyurin/ai-agent.git
cd ai-agent
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Optional for debugging:
```bash
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-langchain-key"
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="ai-agent"
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:7860`

3. Enter search parameters:
    - Keywords: Search terms for papers
    - Intent: Research goal or specific interest
    - Date range: Filter papers by publication date
    - Number of results: How many papers to analyze (1-20)

4. Review results and optionally:
    - Continue search with refined intent
    - Stop search when satisfied with results

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Search Pipeline**:
    - Paper search using DuckDuckGo
    - Abstract extraction from arXiv
    - Paper summarization
    - Relevance analysis
    - Result ranking

2. **State Management**:
    - Session tracking
    - State persistence
    - Iterative refinement

3. **Models**:
    - `Paper`: Basic paper metadata
    - `PaperSummary`: Includes AI-generated summary
    - `PaperExplanation`: Adds relevance explanation
    - `RankedPaper`: Includes relevance score
    - `SearchQuery`: Search parameters and session info
    - `AgentState`: Workflow state tracking

### Workflow

1. **Search**: Find papers matching keywords and date range
2. **Summarize**: Generate concise summaries
3. **Explain**: Analyze relevance to search intent
4. **Rank**: Score papers based on relevance
5. **Review**: Present results for user feedback
6. **Refine**: Optionally continue with new intent

## Error Handling

- Rate limiting protection for DuckDuckGo searches
- Validation for date formats and ranges
- Error handling for paper abstract extraction
- Score normalization for paper rankings

## Development Notes

- Maximum 3 iterations per search session
- Scores normalized to 0-10 range
- Configurable result limit (1-20 papers)
- Asynchronous processing for LLM operations

## Future Improvements

- Add result caching
- Add saving results to files functionality
- Enhance ranking algorithm
- Add export functionality for results
- Add support for additional paper repositories
- Add paper clustering by topic
